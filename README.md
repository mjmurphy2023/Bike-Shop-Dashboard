## Bike Shop Power BI Dashboard 

### Project Description:
Welcome to the Bike Shop Power BI Dashboard! This dashboard is designed to empower data-driven decision-making for a bike shop by providing actionable insights into sales performance, customer behavior, and operational efficiency. The purpose of this project is to enable stakeholders to monitor critical business metrics such as revenue, product trends, and regional sales performance. Through detailed visualizations, users can analyze key performance indicators (KPIs), track order fulfillment, identify top-selling products, and optimize customer retention strategies. The dashboard ultimately helps to enhance business performance by aligning data insights with strategic goals.

### Features:
- **Regional Performance:** Compare sales and profitability across regions (e.g., North America, Europe, and Pacific) to identify high-performing areas and optimize sales strategies.
- **Product-Level Trends:** Analyze detailed sales and return rates of products such as bikes, accessories, and clothing, identifying top-performing products and those with higher return rates.
- **Customer Analytics:** Insights into average purchase frequency, customer churn rate, and lifetime value (CLV) help in understanding customer behavior and retention strategies.
- **Financial KPIs:** Track total revenue, average revenue per customer, profit margins, and goal attainment across months and years.
- **Operational Efficiency:** Monitor order fulfillment, return volumes, and performance against targets to ensure operational goals are met.

### Supply Chain Role Alignment:
The dashboard provides critical insights that align with various supply chain roles:

- **Supply Chain Planner:** Utilize data on order volume, product performance, and regional sales to forecast demand, ensure inventory optimization, and adjust production schedules.
- **Demand Analyst:** Monitor trends in customer behavior, sales performance, and seasonal variations to improve demand forecasting and reduce stockouts or overstock situations.
- **Logistics Coordinator:** Leverage insights on regional performance and returns to optimize shipping routes, reduce return volumes, and enhance distribution efficiency.
- **Procurement Specialist:** Analyze product demand and supplier performance data to ensure that raw materials and products are sourced efficiently and in line with demand fluctuations.
- **Customer Relationship Manager:** Use customer lifetime value, churn rate, and purchase frequency insights to develop customer retention strategies, identify high-value customers, and personalize marketing efforts.

### Business Intelligence Workflow:
The project follows a comprehensive business intelligence workflow:

1. **Data Preparation:** Automated workflows to extract, clean, and transform raw data using Power Query, preparing it for analysis.
2. **Data Modeling:** Creation of a relational data model with normalized tables, star schemas, and effective relationships between fact and dimension tables.
3. **Calculated Fields with DAX:** Use of DAX to create calculated columns, measures, and time intelligence patterns for more advanced analysis.
4. **Data Visualization:** Design of interactive and professional-quality dashboards to deliver insights through visuals such as KPIs, charts, and slicers.

### Conclusion:
The Bike Shop Power BI Dashboard serves as a powerful tool for business intelligence and supply chain management, allowing data-driven decision-making across various roles. By leveraging the detailed analysis provided, stakeholders can optimize operations, improve customer satisfaction, and increase profitability.
